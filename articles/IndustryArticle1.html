    <p>
        Production workers at Walt Disney Animation Studios officially have a first union contract.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a ratification vote that took ended on Wednesday, 93 percent of participating bargaining unit members voted to support a deal reached on Feb. 13, while 7 percent voted against. Ninety-six percent of union members turned out to vote on the agreement, which is a sideletter to The Animation Guild‘s preexisting contract with Walt Disney Animation Studios.
    <p>
        The agreement offers the unit’s production coordinators, production supervisors and production managers pension and health benefits and amplified minimum wage rates. The union claims that minimum rates have gone up 24 percent for production managers, 29 percent for production supervisors and 35 percent for production coordinators as a result of the negotiation.
