        Disney has filed a patent for advancements in animatronic projection technology, which could potentially use AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        The patent is titled “Dynamic augmented projected show elements.” It was filed on March 1, 2024, and published on September 4, 2025. The inventors are Alfredo Medina Ayala Jr., Nicholas Daniel Gathany, Jonathan Bogie, Brent Yuzo Uramoto, Douglas Fidaleo, and Joel Peavy.
    </p>

        In short, the patent describes advancements in projections on animatronics. While Disney has had mixed results with projected faces, for example on Frozen Ever After at EPCOT, the methods described in this patent would hopefully create more realistic imagery.
    </p>
    <p>
        The projected image could be dynamically rendered using a system akin to a game engine and based on input from sensors on the animatronic. The engine could communicate between the projector and animatronic, controlling both to create synchronized movements. The patent allows for multiple projectors that could create blended imagery. It also includes projected light creating realistic elements like blood flow, shadows, skin texture, and fine facial movements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) could also be used to render projected content and animatronic movements, going so far as to identify guest interactions with the animatronic like speech and gestures so it can respond appropriately. The patent also references a real-time puppet, which could be a computing system, model, or human-operated system, which could similarly interact with guests in real-time, potentially using a large language model (LLM).
    </p>
    <p>
        The patent notes, “Projections can appear warped, misplaced, or otherwise unrealistic due to movement of an animatronic where the projections are not rendered for the specific movements of the animatronic.” Disney hopes to better account for this issue with the new technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Advanced projections could help cut down on maintenance time and costs for animatronics.
